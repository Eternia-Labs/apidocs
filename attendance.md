# What is Attendance Third Party Integration

The service allows existing implementations of attendance systems in properties to be integrated with SmartClean's attendance management system.

Existing attendance system examples include kiosks at property entrances, thumbprint readers, face recognition based systems, etc.

*Note*: It is not recommended to send sensitive data in the above API, such as country specific person identifiers.
A property specific identifier mapped in the integration is enough.
